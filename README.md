# Ka-52-2D-Simulator
This is a repository for a pygame game featuring a complex, with simple graphics, ka-52.

This game will be open source, so everyone is welcome to report any bugs, propose features, or even participate in the making of the game! 
*******JUST ONE RULE: **EXPLAIN YOUR CODE!**, as I am not in your mind, I cannot understand why you did something this way and not another.


How the game would work:
The game will be a light(as in resources), but still complex, recreating a realistic 2d top view simulation of the russian helicopter Ka-52. Its design shall be very simple, from textures to colors(main colors are yellow and black). It will focus to be a desktop game, but could become a mobile game(probably for large screen devices like tablets) in the future!
The code is and will be open source, written mainly in python(for ease of maintenance), but can change in the future(maybe a new easier and better language) and readable so people can make mods for the game(enhancements, adding features that doesn't benefit enough people to become a main feature).
