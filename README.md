# Ka-52-2D-Simulator
This is a repository for a pygame game featuring a complex, with simple graphics, ka-52.

This game will be open source, so everyone is welcome to report any bugs, propose features, or even participate in the making of the game! 
*******JUST ONE RULE: **EXPLAIN YOUR CODE!**, as I am not in your mind, I cannot understand why you did something this way and not another.
