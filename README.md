# Ka-52-2D Simulator
This is a repository for a pygame game featuring a complex, with simple graphics, ka-52.

This game will be open source, so everyone is welcome to report any bugs, propose features, or even participate in the making of the game! 
*******JUST ONE RULE: **EXPLAIN YOUR CODE!**, as I am not in your mind, I cannot understand why you did something this way and not another.



How the game would work:

Graphics: simple, using mostly green, red, green, white, and black(background).Kinda like endless ATC.

Hardware requirements: They should be kept to a minimum, as many will play it on low-end work computers(I would aim the game to be superportable, as in a flashdrive)

Code: Mainly in python, for ease of maintenance, but not required(only use languages that are known to others maintainers)

Languages: The project will focus on english and russian, and will extend to other later 

User manual: Will be a downloadable PDF based on the wiki page on the github page
